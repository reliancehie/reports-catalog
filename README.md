## OHA 2018 CCO Incentive and Performance Reports  
The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) uses quality health metrics to show how well Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) are improving care, making quality care accessible, eliminating health disparities, and curbing the rising cost of health care. These outcome and quality measures are developed by the OHA Metrics and Scoring Committee and can be found here:   
<http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/CCO-Baseline-Data.aspx>  
The default measurement period for the following reports is Calendar Year 2018, but the user can choose a measurement period of their choice.

## HEDIS Reports
HEDIS is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. Because so many plans collect HEDIS data, and because the measures are so specifically defined, HEDIS makes it possible to compare the performance of health plans on an "apples-to-apples" basis. Health plans also use HEDIS results themselves to see where they need to focus their improvement efforts.  
See <http://www.ncqa.org/hedis-quality-measurement> for details.

## Appendix


### Community Health Record  
The Community Health Record (CHR) is a tool that allows users to more easily access patient records.  The CHR gives users access to to their entire patient population and facilities a patient has visited across the entire health information exchange. The CHR consists of following main sections: Patient Lookup, the initial patient search that must be completed before viewing a patient.  Lastname or Medical Record Number (MRN) are required to search for a patient.  A combination of Lastname and minimum first three letters of a patient name is also allowed; Patient Info, patient demographics only if the patient is not a member of the users organization or patient demographics and a list of providers, problems, medications, allergies, procedures, and medical insurance information;  Patient Summary, a quick overview of the patient with the five most recent Admits/Discharges/Registrations, Labs, Radiology, Transcribed Reports, Medications List, and Filled Medication messages; Admits/Discharges/Registrations, all ADT messages associated with a patient; Labs, all lab messages associated with a patient; Transcribed Reports, all transcription messages associated with a patient; Radiology, all radiology messages associated with a patient; CCDs, all Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) associated with a patient; Medications List, all medications associated with a patient from either HL7 or CCD messages; Filled Medications, all filled medications associated with a patient from National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) messages; Observation/Vitals, all vitals associated with a patient; and All, a combination of all HL7 and CCD messages associated with a patient.  
Note that all grids and sections in the CHR are displayed in reverse chronological order.  All tabs display information for the last two years, but this can be changes by clicking the filter icon to search for any date range.  

### Glossary 
__Denominator__    
The lower part of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. The denominator is associated with a given patient population that may be counted as eligible to meet a measure’s inclusion requirements.  The denominator is a subset of the initial patient population (IPP) and might be the same as the IPP.  
__Exceptions__    
The members of the denominator that were considered for membership in the numerator, but were rejected, and meet the logic required for the exception criteria.  
__Exclusions__    
The members of the denominator that should not be considered for inclusion in the numerator.  
__Initial Patient Population__      
The set of patients (or episodes of care) to be evaluated by the measure.    
__Measurement Period__    
The time period for which the eMeasure applies.  
__Numerator__      
A subset of the Denominator. The numerator criteria are the processes or outcomes expected for each patient, procedure, or other unit of measurement defined in the denominator.    
__Performance Ratio__    
Performance Ratio = Numerator Count / (Denominator Count – Exclusion Count – Exception Count)
