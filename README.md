## OHA CCO Incentive and Performance Reports  
The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) uses quality health metrics to show how well Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) are improving care, making quality care accessible, eliminating health disparities, and curbing the rising cost of health care. These outcome and quality measures are developed by the OHA Metrics and Scoring Committee and can be found here:

### Consolidated Patient Chart  
The Consolidated Patient Chart (CPC) is a tool that allows users to more easily access patient records. CPC consists of three main sections: Summary, a quick overview of the patient; History, a timeline and charts of the patient's measurements; and Details, an in-depth analysis of the records.  

### Glossary 
__Denominator__    
The lower part of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. The denominator is associated with a given patient population that may be counted as eligible to meet a measureâ€™s inclusion requirements.  The denominator is a subset of the initial patient population (IPP) and might be the same as the IPP.  
__Exceptions__    
The members of the denominator that were considered for membership in the numerator, but were rejected, and meet the logic required for the exception criteria.  
__Exclusions__    
The members of the denominator that should not be considered for inclusion in the numerator.  
__Initial Patient Population__      
The set of patients (or episodes of care) to be evaluated by the measure.    
__Measurement Period__    
The time period for which the eMeasure applies.  
__Numerator__      
A subset of the Denominator. The numerator criteria are the processes or outcomes expected for each patient, procedure, or other unit of measurement defined in the denominator.    
__Performance Ratio__    
Performance Ratio = Numerator Count / (Denominator Count â€“ Exclusion Count â€“ Exception Count)
