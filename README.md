# Reliance Insight Report Catalog

### NOTICE ###
In response to the COVID-19 crisis, Reliance is working to help our stakeholders with actionable data. We have released two reports, available to all Reliance data contributors in the Notifications Dashboard, in the hopes that accurate data can help coordinate care to those in need and help slow the spread of the virus.  

The [*COVID-19 Symptoms and Comorbidities Report*](#covid-19-symptoms-with-comorbidities) identifies patients who have symptoms (or other coded concepts) that qualify them as potentially afflicted with the COVID-19 disease. The report is meant to be a “wide-net” identification report to help Reliance stakeholders aggregate data from the community and see in one view who may have COVID-19. It then appends useful data about those patients to coordinate appropriate care. Some examples of those additional data elements are: demographic information including address, clinical message info (date of service, record type, sending facility, encounter temperature reading if available, COVID-19 related DX code), and whether the patient has a previous diagnosis of several known comorbidities.   

The [*COVID-19 Lab Results Report*](#covid-19-lab-results) identifies lab results specific to COVID-19 infection. The report searches the Reliance dataset for relevant results regardless of whether an infection is detected or otherwise. Patient demographics and test information are included for each result. Report filters are also included for:  

* Result Type (LAB, MICRO, BLB, PTH, RAD)
* COVID19 Result Status (ALL RESULTS, DETECTED, NOT DETECTED)
* Final Status (FINAL, PRELIMINARY, CORRECTED, INCOMPLETE, UNMAPPED)
* State (ALL STATES and states by 2 letter abbreviation)
* Include Transcriptions (checkbox)

Having the most current contact information for patients and members is especially critical during the outbreak.

The [*Patient Contact Info Report*](#patient-contact-info), now available on all Insight dashboards, searches the Reliance dataset for the latest contact information available for patients such as primary address and phone, next of kin phone, and email. For each data element, the date of service from the source is also listed so users understand how contemporary the information is.

The Reliance Team would like to re-emphasize that COVID-19 situation is rapidly evolving, along with the quantity and content of clinical data we are receiving from the community.
We will continue to rapidly iterate on this reporting as we receive input and perform additional data validation. For examples of what other [SHIEC](https://strategichie.com/) HIEs nationally are doing click [here](https://strategichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SHIEC_COVID-19_one-pager-Ppt-12-Merged-3-27-20-FINAL-1.pdf). Here are some additional data elements we are planning or considering (either in the current report or in other views/reports):

* viral test status (COVID-19 specific, rapid flu, PCR respiratory panel)
* social risk factor statuses such as indications of housing or food insecurity
* referral for COVID-19 testing
* indications of a quarantine order
* aggregated or deidentified views for public health usage (including maps)
* timeseries trending

 We welcome feedback and suggestions to prioritize our efforts and to improve the usefulness of our data. Please direct any questions or comments to the helpdesk@reliancehie.org

### Dental Sealants on Permanent Molars for Children
**Measure Description**   
Percentage of children ages 6-14 who received a dental sealant during the measurement year.  
**2019 Measure Benchmark**  
26.8%, 2017 CCO 90th percentile  
**Denominator**  
Total unduplicated number of individuals ages 6-9 and 10-14 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year. Note the cited measures include two age ranges, 6-9 and 10-14. OHA will measure and report each of these age ranges separately, but the rates will be combined (creating a weighted average by adding numerators and denominators, rather than averaging the rates) for comparison to the benchmark and for calculating the incentive payment.  
The CCO incentive measure does not incorporate the Dental Quality Alliance criteria for identifying children at elevated caries risk the denominator. The Dental Quality Alliance is currently the specifications.  
For CMS Medicaid Child Core Set measure reporting which adopts the Dental Quality Alliance specifications for age 6-9, OHA is required to only report the members with elevated caries risk in the denominator. Elevated caries risk is determined as follows:  
* Any children with a visit with D0602 or D0603 during the measurement year; OR
* Any children with a service code among those in Table 1 in the measurement year; OR
* Any children with a service code among those in Table 1 in any of the three years prior to the measurement year (Note the child does not need to be continuously enrolled for any of these three years, this is simply a look back for any claims history).  
* The EPSDT Form CMS-416 specifications use the Federal Fiscal Year (FFY); OHA’s specifications will use the calendar year.  
* The EPSDT Form CMS-416 specifications also use September 30th as the date to determine age; OHA’s specifications will use December 31st.  

**Numerator**  
Unduplicated number of children ages 6-9 and 10-14 who received a sealant on a permanent molar tooth, as defined by HCPCS code D1351 (CDT code D1351), during the measurement year. Sealants can be placed by any dental professional for whom placing a sealant is within his or her scope of practice.  
As the majority of the dental sealant services are submitted to MMIS in the dental claim format, per EPSDT Form CMS-416 specification, only sealant services on permanent molars (including the third molars, also known as the wisdom teeth), as identified by teeth numbered 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 30, 31, 32 will count towards the numerator.  
For the dental sealant services submitted through medical professional or facility claims, the tooth number information is not available on the claim form and therefore not required for inclusion in the numerator; any sealant code D1351 submitted through medical professional or facility claims will be included in the numerator. This is a deviation from the EPSDT Form CMS-416 specification.  
**Deviations from cited specifications for numerator**  
To encourage CCOs integration of medical practice with oral health, OHA accepts dental sealant services submitted through the medical claims format, and the CDT code D1351 alone is valid for the numerator without the tooth number specified (see numerator data requirement above). Note that while dental sealant services can be provided in medical or community-based settings and submitted through medical claims, sealants can only be placed by qualified dental providers. See the Dental Sealant Guidance Document for additional information on which provider types can provide sealants. http://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/CCO-Baseline-Data.aspx  
The Dental Quality Alliance specifications (and the CMS Child Core Set specifications) require determining the numerator claims from dental providers, using provider taxonomy codes (see the cited specifications for more detail). OHA CCO incentive measure specifications align with EPSDT Form CMS416 and do not use taxonomy codes in the calculation.

## HEDIS Reports
HEDIS is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. Because so many plans collect HEDIS data, and because the measures are so specifically defined, HEDIS makes it possible to compare the performance of health plans on an apples-to-apples basis. Health plans also use HEDIS results themselves to see where they need to focus their improvement efforts.  
See <http://www.ncqa.org/hedis-quality-measurement> for details.

## Appendix


### Community Health Record  
The Community Health Record (CHR) is a tool that allows users to more easily access patient records. The CHR gives users access to to their entire patient population and facilities a patient has visited across the entire health information exchange. The CHR consists of following main sections: Patient Lookup, the initial patient search that must be completed before viewing a patient.  Lastname or Medical Record Number (MRN) are required to search for a patient.  A combination of Lastname and minimum first three letters of a patient name is also allowed; Patient Info, patient demographics only if the patient is not a member of the users organization or patient demographics and a list of providers, problems, medications, allergies, procedures, and medical insurance information;  Patient Summary, a quick overview of the patient with the five most recent Admits/Discharges/Registrations, Labs, Radiology, Transcribed Reports, Medications List, and Filled Medication messages; Admits/Discharges/Registrations, all ADT messages associated with a patient; Labs, all lab messages associated with a patient; Transcribed Reports, all transcription messages associated with a patient; Radiology, all radiology messages associated with a patient; CCDs, all Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) associated with a patient; Medications List, all medications associated with a patient from either HL7 or CCD messages; Filled Medications, all filled medications associated with a patient from National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) messages; Observation/Vitals, all vitals associated with a patient; and All, a combination of all HL7 and CCD messages associated with a patient.  
Note that all grids and sections in the CHR are displayed in reverse chronological order.  All tabs display information for the last two years, but this can be changes by clicking the filter icon to search for any date range.

### Glossary
__Denominator__    
The lower part of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. The denominator is associated with a given patient population that may be counted as eligible to meet a measure’s inclusion requirements.  The denominator is a subset of the initial patient population (IPP) and might be the same as the IPP.  
__Exceptions__    
The members of the denominator that were considered for membership in the numerator, but were rejected, and meet the logic required for the exception criteria.  
__Exclusions__    
The members of the denominator that should not be considered for inclusion in the numerator.  
__Initial Patient Population__      
The set of patients (or episodes of care) to be evaluated by the measure.    
__Measurement Period__    
The time period for which the eMeasure applies.  
__Numerator__      
A subset of the Denominator. The numerator criteria are the processes or outcomes expected for each patient, procedure, or other unit of measurement defined in the denominator.    
__Performance Ratio__    
Performance Ratio = Numerator Count / (Denominator Count – Exclusion Count – Exception Count)
